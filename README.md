# Simon-Game
### I have made this Simon-Game as a project to improve my JavaScript Skills and also to have some Fun. <br>

#### Head over  <a href="https://being-vishal.github.io/Simon-Game/"> here </a> to play.

#### Not aware of the rules for Simon Game? Don't worry I have got you covered. Here's the Gameplay:-
<ul>
<li>The screen will display four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when 
it is pressed or activated by the device for assigning the pattern. 
<li>A round in the game consists of the device lighting a cloured button in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons.
<li>As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases as the player has to start the order from the beginning. 
If the player isn't able to follow the pattern then game over.




</ul>
